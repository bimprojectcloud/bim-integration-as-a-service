# bim-integration-as-a-service

This repository contains examples of using bimproject.cloud platform to integrate with bim software (Graphisoft Archicad, Autodesk Revit).

Current implementation requires a `bimType` (data you wish to add to user's project, data structure documentation provided by BIM Project) and a connection string (token issued by BIM Project to authenticate request within the platform).

Select implementation based on your project needs. See examples of

#### [client side only integration](./examples/client/README.md)
#### [client-server integration](./examples/server/README.md)
